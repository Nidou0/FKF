											<p>
												
												Our vision is 
												 To realize a Malaysia where all animals are treated as lives
												of equal.
												
												 Our mission is
												 To rally all human beings towards treating all animals
												as a life of equal
												
												 and Our objective is
												 To rescue & rehome severely abused or injured animals.
											</p>
											<h3>A message from our chief animal lover</h3>
											<p>
												"Fur Kids Farm is the culmination of years filled with determination, perseverance,
												and a profound love for animals. Growing up, I had an apprehension towards cats
												and dogs until a fateful day when Ruff, a battered and bruised mixed Golden
												puppy, appeared at my gate. Ruff's arrival marked the beginning of a
												transformative journey. Following him, Tiff, Zaff, and Day, all vulnerable and
												mistreated animals, sought refuge at my gate, finding solace in my care. Initially, I
												never intended to keep them permanently, but as I nursed them back to health
												and sought homes for them, a realization dawned upon me: I had become their
												lifeline, their world, and they had become an inseparable part of my life.
												Somewhere along the way, these precious souls became my babies, and
												together, we formed an unbreakable bond—a family. With time, my family
												expanded, and I embraced the role of a devoted parent to over 300 cats and
												dogs. This journey has brought both immense joy and a sense of parental concern.
												The joy stems from the profound love I share with my furry companions—their
												unwavering loyalty, their endearing gaze, and the happiness they bring to my
												heart. However, my concern extends to the countless other animals out there,
												enduring daily dangers and hardships—often unheard and unreached.
												To make a difference for these voiceless beings, Fur Kids Farm has dedicated itself
												to combating animal abuse and tirelessly works towards ensuring animal welfare
												everywhere. But this mission cannot be accomplished alone. We firmly believe that
												animal welfare is a shared responsibility, a testament to our humanity and the
												bonds we form with animals. That's why we need you. Join us on this transformative
												journey, as together, we celebrate and nurture the love between humans and
												animals. Your involvement can create a lasting impact, bringing about positive
												change in the lives of countless animals. Together, let's embark on this
												compassionate journey and make the world a better place for our furry friends."

													We have successfully rescued over 300 animals. The animals come in extremely bad condition - large maggot-infested open wounds, extremely malnourished, broken limbs and multiple other conditions. They are fearful and withdrawn. They don’t even want to eat.  
												</p>
											</blockquote>
											<h3 class="h2">Our history</h3>
											<p>
												Our journey commences in 2011,<strong> We rescued our first dog. </strong> This was followed by 5 other dogs & 7 other cats in the same year. The treatment & rehabilitation tough as they were severely abused. 
												In 2012, As neighbors & friends heard about the rescues, they started to highlight cases of abuse. This initiated our active rescues. The rescues were tough, dangerous & self funded.
												In 2013, Operating from home, the rescue efforts ran into multiple problems. 	There were neighbors who were abusing the rescues. This required us to urgently move but financial conditions did not permit this.
												In 2014, The shelter was at risk of closing down due to financial constraints. This called for immediate measures to continue saving the animals. This was the beginning of FKF as a organized charity.
												In 2015, started actively engaging communities, businesses & government agencies to secure animal well being everywhere.

											<p>
												FKF rescues both cats and dogs. FKF has a unique 3-step process of treatment, therapy & correction to rehabilitate an animal. We believe all animals deserve the opportunity at a healthy & happy life.
	
											</p>
											<p>
												FKF is not equipped with sufficient facilities. We build temporary houses as we need them for the animals. The reason for this is space as well as financial strain. Our major financial burden is the medical cost as well as food. Abused and seriously injured animal are costly to treat and usually come with prolonged medical needs.
