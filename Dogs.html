												<p>
													
													Anita & Vanita are sisters. They were found in a wet market area with they skin scalding & covered in blood. Vet's best guess is they were beaten with a sharp object. At the point of rescue they were 2 months old. Immigrant workers said their mother was beaten to death but refused to give more information.
													Anita is reserved and shy. However, she will defend her owner when called upon. A brave quiet warrior. She is disciplined and is a sweet friendly child.

												<p>
												

													Baby was abandoned by owner and underwent severe depression. She was surrendered to us for rehabilitation. At the point of surrender, she delivered babies who were taken away from her, and this further aggravated her condition. In time, with the therapy provided, Baby recovered to be a healthy cheerful soul.
													Baby gets startled easily due to her previous trauma. However, she is friendly though she is reserved.

												<p>
													
													Bibi, Indrani, Kanmani, Marimuthu, Rama, Sintamani are 6 siblings abandoned outside our shelter. They were tightly tied up in a plastice bag and were severely malnourished and deyhdrated as we do not know how long they had been out there. This is part of the reason that FKF choose to keep its location private for the most part.
													She is very shy. Once she knows you, however, she is super duper friendly.

													Candy was found with spinal injury from being beaten. He almost died twice due to physical injury and later undetected internal complications. But he is tough fighter and is now fully recovered.
													Just like the fighter he is, this boy is brave and is always ready to make friends. He is also kind and understanding towards his fellow shelter mates. A kind sweet boy.

													She was almost put down for violence. A pure bred GSD (From Zander - 8th world champion bloodline), she killed everything in sight. A month after she moved in with us, she is now the resident kitten babysitter. A complete gem.
													She is super calm and friendly. The most trusted babysitter of all animals. She is a true darling.
